# Rethinking Residual Errors in Compensation-based LLM Quantization [ICLR'26]

## Motivation
![](./imgs/motivation.png)
We identify the missing residual error term ( We name it 'Compensation-aware Error' ) in GPTAQ, which comes the discrepancy between compensated and original weights. Therefore, our method strictly aligns with the original full-precision ouput at each column.

## Scripts
Our codebase is heavily relied on GPTAQ, with simple modifications. Please see `fake_quant/gptaq_utils_r.py` for details.

Take weight-only quantization as an example:
```
cd fake_quant
bash weight_group_3bit.sh  ### per-group quantization
bash weight_group_2bit.sh  ### Quarot + per-group quantization
```

## Todo List
I'm continuously working on improving the stability of ResComp. Since we form a more precise optimization objective, and we only use 128 samples, it may be more sensitive to the quality of calibration data. I warmly welcome further discussions, feel free to contact me (list@zju.edu.cn).

I'm also seeking collabration opportunity in CUDA kernel optimization to better support SSVQ.
